		<h2>What is Spectroscopy?</h2>
		<h2>Measuring Concentration with UV-Vis Spectroscopy </h2>
		<p> UltraViolet-VISable light spectroscopy uses a laser within the ultraviolet and visible light spectrum of radiation to measure concentrations of compounds in a solution</p>
		<p>UV-Vis spectroscopy accomplishes this by using a laser, which is difracted against a crystal prism, passed through a polarized filter that allows for a specific spectrum to be used, then passed through the sample, stored in a container knowns as cuvette</p>
		<p>The passthrough is then measured as an absorbance reading by a Charge Coupling Device, and analysed using computer software in accordance to Beer's Law</p>

		<h3>Case Study:Bradford Assays</h3>
		<h2>Radical Mechanisms with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</h2>
		<p>In quantum mechanics, electrons usually are paired. However, many chemical reactions involved lone electrons, known as radicals</p>
		<p>Using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)</p>
