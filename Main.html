<p>~ Structural Biology is a field of interest within biology that seeks to gain insight i
nto the role of shape and composition in biological chemicals </p>
<p>~ These Biomolecules often include rather large compounds, known as macromolecules. Macromolecules include </p>
<p>~	1. Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) - The genetic code of all living things, and is therefore responsible for most, if not all interactions within all living things  </p>
<p>~	2. Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA) - An intermediary compound between the processing of DNA and formation of proteins. Ironically, researchers now believe that RNA predates DNA </p> 
<p>~	3. Proteins, Enzymes, and Peptides - The final result of DNA processing, and is re:sponsible for processing , structure, and regulation within living things.</p>
<p>~	4. Lipids- Fats, steroids, and some hormones provide structure and regulation </p>
<p>~ These compounds play a crucial role in the survival of living things, and even in the survival of non-living things, such as viruses, viroids (free-floating DNA or RNA), and prions (proteins that damage the structure of other proteins). </p>

<p> ~ Scientists are constantly unearthing increasing amounts of biological data, leading to the problem of not only storing and sharing this data in a universally accessible manner, but also using this data in a meaningful manner </p> 
<p>This has lead to the advent of free to use databases such as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/">UNIPROT</a> , which catalogue a litany of biological data</p>
<img src="./GRAPHICS/Cuda.png" style="float:right;width:200px;height:100px;" alt="NVIDIA CUDA is a hardware acceleration platform">

<p>~ In order to solve increasingly complex biological problems, scientists and doctors make use of High Performance Computing and hardware acceleration to expedite the process of solving, or in many cases, approximating, and some problems are unsolvable by computers, these biological problems.  </p>

* MATHEMATICS IN BIOLOGY *
**************************
</pre></h2>
<p>~ We use mathematics to make quantifiable sense of our surroundings  </p>
<p>~ Mathematics in biology addresses a variety of problems, including biostatistics and public health, chemical bonding, diffusion in the cell, population dynamics, and predator-prey relationships. </p>
<p>~ Some of these biological and chemical observations are stochastic, meaning that many of the variables can vary drastically, or in many cases such as the weather, be completely random </p>
