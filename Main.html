<p>~ Structural Biology is a field of interest within biology that seeks to gain insight i
nto the role of shape and composition in biological chemicals </p>
<p>~ These biomolecules often include rather large compounds, known as macromolecules. Macromolecules include </p>
<ul>
<li>DeoxyriboNucleic Acid <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Deoxyribonucleic-Acid" >(DNA)</a> - The genetic code of all living things, and is therefore responsible for most, if not all interactions within all living things  </li>
<li>RiboNucleic Acid <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/RNA-Ribonucleic-Acid">(RNA)</a> - An intermediary compound between the processing of DNA and formation of proteins. Ironically, researchers now believe that RNA predates DNA </li> 
<li><a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Protein">Proteins</a>, Enzymes, and Peptides - The final result of DNA processing, and is responsible for processing , structure, and regulation within living things. An example being the Keratin helix <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UUI">6UUI</a> to the right</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rxlist.com/lipid/definition.html">Lipids</a>- Fats, steroids, and some hormones provide structure and regulation </li>
</ul>
<p>~ These compounds play a crucial role in the survival of living things, and even in the survival of non-living things, such as viruses, viroids (free-floating DNA or RNA), and prions (proteins that damage the structure of other proteins) </p>

* COMPUTERS FOR BIOLOGY *

</h2>
<p> ~ Scientists are constantly unearthing increasing amounts of biological data, leading to the problem of not only storing and sharing this data in a universally accessible manner, but also using this data in a meaningful manner </p> 
<p>This has lead to the advent of free to use databases such as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/">UNIPROT</a> , which catalogue a litany of biological data</p>
<img src="./GRAPHICS/Cuda.png" style="float:right;width:300px;height:150px;" alt="NVIDIA CUDA is a hardware acceleration platform">

<p>~ In order to solve increasingly complex biological problems, scientists and doctors make use of High Performance Computing<a href="https://insidehpc.com/hpc-basic-training/what-is-hpc/">(HPC)</a> and hardware acceleration to expedite the process of solving, or in many cases, approximating, these biological problems </p>

* MATHEMATICS IN BIOLOGY *
**************************
</pre></h2>
<p>~ We use mathematics to make quantifiable sense of our surroundings  </p>
<p>~ Mathematics in biology addresses a variety of problems, including biostatistics and public health, chemical bonding, diffusion in the cell, population dynamics, and predator-prey relationships </p>
<p>~ Some of these biological and chemical observations are stochastic, meaning that many of the variables can vary drastically, or in many cases such as the weather, be completely random </p>
