<h1>Lipids, Steroids, and Hormones: The Smaller Structures</h1>

<h2>What are Lipids?</h2>

<p>Lipids constitute a broad range of biochemicals such as cholesterol, fats, fat-soluble vitamins waxes and in many cases, synthetic soaps and detergents.</p>
<p> The study of lipids and their structures have applications in agriculture, consumer products, and medicine and pharmaceuticals. 
</p>



<p>Lipids are often insoluble in water, often due to their long, appendage-like carbon chains. Additionally, some lipids, such as the Phospholipids, have charged heads, and water insoluble (or hydrophobic) tails, allowing for the formation of structures such as the micelle, often exploited by soaps to trap dirt, or the bilayer, forming the memberane of cells</p>

<h2>What are Hormones and Steroids?</h2>
<p>Hormones are signalling molecules, and are used by cells as a regulatory mechanism. Hormones can be used to regulate intracellular processes, or can be used to communicate with other cells.</p>

<p>Hormones are a diverse set of molecules, and can include:

<ul style="color:#fdfe64;font-size:18px;">

	<li>Singular Amino Acids, such as Histamine, which is implicated in allergic reactions</li>
	<li>Entire proteins, such as Insulin, used to regulate glucose, and medicated to Type 1 Diabetics</li>
	<li>Fatty Acid derivatives, known as eicosanoids, such as THC, found in Marijuana</li> 
	<li>Smaller organics molecules such as Ethylene, which can regulate fruit ripening</li>
	<li>Steroids, such as Testosterone, which can regulates sexual development in males, and universally prevents osteoporosis</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Hormones interact with receptor proteins, which in turn either restrict, or allow certain biological activities. Examples of receptors include:</p>
<ul style="color:#fdfe64;font-size:18px;">
	<li>The Neuromuscular Junction, which allows Acetylcholine to regulate muscle flexing</li>
	<li>Glucocorticoid Receptor, which regulates metabolism</li>
	<li>Retinoic Acid Receptor, which binds with Vitamin A</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Study: Transgender Hormone Therapy</h3>
<p>Individuals with either clinical Gender Dysphoria or non-clinical gender incongruities will often use hormone therapy as part of a more broad gender affirmation. Such therapies take advantage of the fact that animal development is highly dependent on hormones for regulation.</p>

<p>Feminizing hormone therapy often employs steroidal and non-steroidal anti-androgen compounds, such as Estradiol and its derivatives, and estrogen. Estradiol and Estrogen bind with the Estrogen Receptor (ER), causing migration and direct binding to the DNA to facilitate the transcription of specific genes into RNA, which is destined to become its respective protein. Ultimately this causes secondary sexual effects such as breast development, fat redistribution, and decreased sperm count.</p>

<p>Masculinizing hormone therapy often uses Testosterone, which interacts with the Androgen Receptor (AR), which in turn binds to specific elements of DNA, and enhances transcription to RNA and translation to proteins. Additionally, masculinizing therapy will use Aromatase Inhibitors and 5-Alpha-Reductase inhibitors. Usually used to treat early breast cancer, Aromatase Inhibitors inhibit the enzyme Aromatase, which process Testosterone and Androstenedione into the estrogens Estradiol and Estrone, respectively. Such treatment leads to the buildup of hormones usually associated with masculine sexual features.  </p>
