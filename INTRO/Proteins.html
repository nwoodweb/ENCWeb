<h1> Proteins : Microscopic Tools </h1>
<hr style="color:black;">

<img src="../GRAPHICS/CDK_1RGS.png" style="float:right;width:500px;height:375px;">
<p> Proteins are rather large biomolecules, and are the main means for living things to interact with their environments.</p>
<h2>What are Proteins Made of ?</h2>
<p>The monomers, or individual parts, of proteins, are known as amino acids, 21 of which are the essential components of all proteins.</p>
<p>These monomers are linked in peptide bonds, to form a sequence, or primary structure.</p>
<p>The primary structure undergoes physical interactions known as folding. Protein folding can form elaborate structures such as helices as seen in cyan to the right, or pleated sheets, as seen in magenta to the right</p>
<p>These elaborate secondary structures as a whole form tertiary structures, often consisting of subunits of an even larger protein, whose final structure is known as the quaternary structure</p>


<h2>What do Proteins Do ?</h2>



<h3> Providing Structure and Transportation </h3>
<p>Many proteins solely provide structure within the cell's outer membrane/wall, the cell's individual components, known as organelles, or to maintain rigidity of the cell itself. Furthermore, the manipulation of structural proteins allow the cell to have motion </p>
<h4>Case Study: The Microtubules as Scaffolding  </h4>
<p>Non-bacteria cells, known as eukaryotes, use microtubules to provide rigidity.</p>

</center>
<p>Microtubules are polymers of Alpha and Beta Tubulin proteins, arranged in linear filaments. Microtubules are constantly being constructed and reconstructed, and nucleate from structures known as Microtubule Organizing Centers (MTOCs) </p>

<p>Additionally, microtubules bind to chromosomes during cell division, and ensure that equal numbers of chromosomes are transfered between the parent and child cells.</p>


<p>Microtubules are also used by motor proteins, known as Kinesins and Dyneins, which consume energy to "walk" across the Microtubules and transport proteins in packages known as vesicles.</p>

<h3>Processing Molecules </h3>
<p>Many proteins, known as enzymes, are capable of processing smaller molecules, known as ligands, in a process known as catalysis</p>

</figure>

<p>Catalysis occurs in what is known as the active site of an enzyme, in which the protein-ligand interaction causes a change in the geometry of the whole complex, causing the observable change</p>
<p>Catalysis can either break (such as Catylase, which breaks down Hydrogen Peroxide) or combine molecules (such as ATP Synthase) in a complex fashion. Each enzyme is given an Enzyme Classification number, based on its observed activity.  </p>
<p>Additionally, other smaller molecules, while not ligands specifically, can inhibit the catalysis of proteins. This is accomplished by either directly competing for binding in the active site, or through binding a secondary protein feature known as an allosteric site</p>


<h4>Case Study: Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria</h4>
<p>Researchers are facing the conundrum involving disease-causing bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotic medications</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance occurs spontaneously in the absense of antibiotics. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, those resistant to antibiotics will usually be the sole survivors</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance is usually passive in the sense that it is achieved by small mutations in the systems that are respectively targeted by antibiotics, such as Rifampicin's ability to impair the transcription of DNA into RNA, which can be countered with a modified RNA Polymerase</p>

<p>Other bacteria produce enzymes that will actively degrade antibiotics. Beta-Lactamases, such as TEM1, are capable of breaking down the Beta-Lactam ring structure in many popular antibiotics, such as Penicllin. The breakdown of the Beta-Lactamase ring degrades the antibiotic and renders it ineffective</p>


<h3>Signalling and Regulation</h3> 
<p> Cells and organisms at large need a means to control the production of biomolecules to acheive a desired effect, maintain survivability, or to ensure the resources being consumed equals the resources being introduced into the cell.</p>

<p>Many proteins, when interacting with a ligand, serve as a "checkpoint," and regulate the extent in which other sequential processes can happen. These processes can range from the mundane, such as regulating the consumption of lactose by bacteria, to the grand, such as the formation of blood clots, or the instruction for individual cells to self-destruct to slow the spread of cancerous mutations.<p>
<h4>Case Study: Your Copy of Sonic Hedgehog</h4>
<p>
Limb development is essential for almost all animals, even ones that do not have limbs. During the development of an embryo, a myriad of regulatory and signal proteins are required to facilitate the proper development of limbs
</p>
<p>Many of these proteins have typical names, such as Zone of Polarizing Activity, or Bone Morphogenic Protein. However, the most famous protein involved in embryonic development is an equally famous fictitious person </p>

	<figcaption style="font-size:20px;color:#6c71c4">Named after the video game characher, Sonic Hedgehog is responsible for embryonic development</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
</center>
<p>Named this way after a researcher's young daughter was allowed to chime in, Sonic Hedgehog is responsible for the following:
<ul style="font-size:18px;color:#fdfe64;">
	<li>Development of notochord during embryo formation, eventually becoming the spinal chord</li>
	<li>Development of limbs and limb digits</li>
	<li>Development of lungs</li>
	<li>Partitioning the brain into hemispheres</li>
	<li>Slowing down the spread of cancer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Sonic Hedgehog plays a critical role in embryonic development and the prevention of cancer. Mutations to its corresponding gene SHH and consumption of medications such as Accutane during pregnancy can lead to debilitating congenital birth defects or the development of cancers. Research by the University of Florida suggests that snakes do not have limbs due to a mutation in Sonic Hedgehog that had been compounded over millions of years of sexual reproduction, as evidenced by fossils of snakes with hampered limb development and laboratory experimentation</p> 

<p>There are many more regulatory proteins and genes that have unusual, names, including:
<ul style="font-size:18px;color:#fdfe64;">
	<li><i>Tinman</i>, which regulates heart development</li>
	<li><i>I'm Not Dead Yet</i> and <i>Methuselah</i>, both of which regulate aging</li> 
	<li><i>Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAP4K)</i>, which plays a role in cell signalling to other cells in larger organisms, or responding to external events in individual cells</li>
</ul>
