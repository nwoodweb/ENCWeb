<h2>Cryo-Electron Microscopy: A Surface Level Approach </h2>
<p>Electron Microscopy is a powerful process of obtaining images of rather small objects. However, the fact that the samples must be purged of all air in a vacuum, and coated in compounds harmful to biomolecules, makes such methods difficult</p>
<p> To resolve this, researchers have developed Cryo-Electron Microscopy (CryoEM), which entails freezing the samples in a specific solution, cutting a thin slice of the sample using a sharp razor known as a microtome, and then conducting the microscopy, as demonstrated below by Gabriel Lander</p>

<p>CryoEM's main flaw is that it is difficult to gain information about the internal features of a protein sample without using artificial intelligence to better resolve the internal features. Regardless, CryoEM remains an excellent method of obtaining a three dimensional surface image of proteins</p>

<h2>Homology Modeling: A Computational Approach</h2>

<p>Sometimes researchers do not have the means to obtain structural data on a protein. To resolve this, researchers can employ a computational prediction method known as homology modeling</p>
<p>Homology modeling (HM) exploits that fact that researches have sequenced a vast number of proteins, and uses these sequences to infer the strucutre of a given protein sequence.</p>
<p>HM completes this by aligning the expermental sequence against the sequence and structure of an already established protein, and then using statistics to score its own predicitons</p>
<p>One of the downsides of HM is that it is entirely devised using statistical predictions, and in its current capacity, typically used as a stopgap until a more absolute image can be obtained.</p>

<p>X-ray protein crystallography (XC) is a technique used to determine the the three dimensional position of each feature of a protein, down to the single atom. XC can further be conducted on small molecules such as cholesterol.</p>

<p> In XC, a sample is painstakingly crystallized from a solution, then cooled with nitrogen as to prevent damage from machinery heat or X-ray impact. The sample is then blasted with X-rays from a device known as a synchrotron. The X-rays diffract when impacting the sample's features, leaving unique marks indicating position and intensity in an image</p>
<p>One dilemma crystallographers face is the image itself. XC images are in inverse space, meaning that the farther the distance between points on an image, the closer those points are in reality.</p>
<p>Crystallographers in the past would then infer the true geometry by hand, which had taken years in many cases. However, crystallographers use a form of computational analysis known as the Fourier Transform to infer the true structure, and can then perform additional analysis</p>
<p>Once analysis has been complete, researchers can submit their images to the Protein DataBank (PDB) databases. PDB databases originated with only 13 structures in 1976, but now host 177009 strucures</p>
<p> The primary downside of XC is the time-intensive nature of obtaining a crystallized sample, if the sample will even crystallize to begin with</p>
